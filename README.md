Diff Launcher written in JS / NodeJS and using Webkit.

Set up by editing the default diff tool and the two repos' paths.
I'm using this to sync between two versioning systems, using the filepaths generated by Git when doing a diff with previous version.

Before being added to the list, files are being checked if they're found in both repos.
